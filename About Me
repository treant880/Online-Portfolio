<p>Hello, my name is Christopher Gibson and I am currently attending Miami University, seeking after a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering. I made this website from scratch as an online portfolio to document my experience in this field. I've already taken two years of college for the College Credit Plus program at Hamilton High School. In the Fall of 2019, I will be officially starting my school career at Miami University. </p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy avidly playing a lot of different varieties of video games, from Borderlands to The Binding of Isaac to The Darkest Dungeon and so on. I've also begun to start coding a little bit in my free time, so that I can create new things and improve my coding skills in the future. I currently have some skills in using HTML and I'm going to start to learn more about CSS and JavaScript in the near future. I also enjoy watching YouTube videos, when I'm not coding or playing video games. However, I also have a wonderful girlfriend that I enjoy spending time with whenever I can as well.</p>

<p>I'm seeking to find a job in computer programming in the near future. I'd preferably like to go into the game programming industry, but with my current skillset, I may seek to work in Web Design before then at the entry level to gain more experience generally and further develop another skillset in this broad field. 

<p>I'm still developing in this field and need to gain more experience, but that's why I'm going to college, to further my knowledge in this field and gain degrees, along with the experience that comes with that, so that I can be a desirable employee in this growing field.

<p>If you'd be interested in contacting me for an internship or for some other work-related purpose, send me an email at gibsoncm9@aol.com or message me on
